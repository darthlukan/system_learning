This is merely a collection of scripts containing
various concepts and templates for those concepts
for the purpose of performing tasks programmatically
on a Linux system.  

Some things (like subprocess calls) describe package
manager calls to 'pacman'.  While 'pacman' is specific
to Arch Linux and its derivatives, the basic concept
shows how to execute a program on the system.

Feel free to fork and add more items to this repo
if you find something lacking or that could
benefit from expansion.
